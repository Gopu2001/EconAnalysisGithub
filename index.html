      <h1>Problem Description</h1>
      <h3>What is GitHub?</h3>
      <p>
        As a developer, open sourcing your code is all the rage. It helps
        beginner and amateur developers gain skills and get noticed in the
        professional community, while also helping recruiters determine if
        an individual is up to a certain task and a good fit for a certain
        role they are hiring for.
      </p><p>
        GitHub plays a major role for this kind of communication between the
        individual looking for a job and recruiting companies looking to hire
        individuals with valuable skills. In fact, because GitHub is used so
        much, countless companies require that job applicants use a GitHub
        account and profile to share their accomplishments and code projects
        they have started and completed.

        The GitHub Website can be accessed by clicking
        <a href="https://github.com/">here</a> or copying and pasting the URL
        https://github.com/ in your web browser's address bar.

        Under a typical secondary school administration network, this is what it looks like when
        attempting to access GitHub.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite having all of these countless benefits, why do some schools,
        particularly school districts that teach high school and middle school
        students ban the use of GitHub on their network server? There's a simple
        reason for that:

      <h1>UNCERTAINTY</h1>
      <h3>An Introduction to Uncertainty</h3>
      <p>
        According to the book <i>Essentials of ECONOMICS Seventh Edition</i>
        written by John Sloman and Dean Garratt, when people are faced with
        making choices based on what they perceive are the consequences of such
        choices, they are faced with the uncertainty of what will happen in the
        future that may be affected by such a decision. Similar to buying a new
        mobile phone that lasts for 5 or so years, writing a rule in a rulebook
        is filled with uncertainty as to how users who abide by the rulebook
        will act (page 65). Just like the colors in the background of this website, you
        do not know which color will appear when you reload the page or even
        the next couple seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Sloman and Garratt, "the more pessimistic we are, the more
        cautious we will be" (page 66) when it comes to understanding how people
        react to uncertainty. In terms of economics, this leads the rule makers
        to determine that the optimal method is to err on the side of pessimism.
