      <h1>Problem Description</h1>
      <h3>Why do Google Suite products matter?</h3>
      <p>
        When I was a high school student, I commonly helped out my friends when
        they struggled in the mathematics courses, especially AP Statistics and
        AP Calculus (both AB and BC), and not to mention the mathematics
        sections on the SAT (as you can tell, I was pretty much the go-to math
        geek when it came to asking for help). Working in-person with my friends
        to go over their troubles in their math class, I often worked out
        practice problems on a scratch sheet of paper, and for additional
        resources, I shared with them a Google Slides presentation that they
        could walk through to recall certain tips and tricks. Using Google Suite
        products really helped me out in these cases as they allowed me edit
        these presentations whenever I wanted to and wherever I was. The benefit
        of working on the cloud is far greater than depending on perfect health,
        especially when it comes to learning remotely during the era of
        COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from these purposes, I commonly used Google Suite tools such as
        Google Slides and Google Docs to communicate with my group members
        during a group project. We would list all of our ideas (scripts when it
        came to filming, tables when it came to documenting what each person
        does, etc.) and meet up to complete our project based on the guide we
        listed in the documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there was a detriment to using Google Suite tools:
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Google Suite is Blocked on the School Network.</h3>
      <h2>Expected output when navigating to <a href="https://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a></h2>
      <img src="GoogleDocsSuccess.jpg" width=100% />
      <h2>Unwanted output when navigating to <a href="https://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a></h2>
      <img src="GoogleDocsFail.jpg" width=100% />
      <p style="text-indent: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 16px;">
        As a result of these blocked websites, we commonly had to use Google
        Suite tools on our phones when we needed to use it for sharing documents
        and other information we otherwise did not have access to under the
        school's network.
      </p>
      <h1>Substitute Goods</h1>
      <h3>What are substitute Goods?</h3>
      <p>
        School administrators cited their number one reason for blocking Google
        Suite products was because they wanted us to use Microsoft's products
        instead. With a school-wide license, everyone has access to Microsoft
        Office 365, . . . but working with them is not as user-friendly as
        Google Suite's tools. Being completely free and 100% on the web, knowing
        how to use Google products was practically required knowledge when it
        came to working on group projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ties in with the economics of substitute goods. According to their
        websites, Microsoft Office 365 for Education is $3.25 per person (max) per
        month school wide, whereas getting the Google Suite for Education plan
        with the same number of features costs about $4 per per person per month.
        Looking at the data, and knowing that the high school has to provide
        approximately 16000 accounts. With Google's plan, my high school would
        have had to pay just under <b>$800,000</b>, however, if my high school
        continues to stick with Microsoft Office 365, the administration would
        have to pay approximately <b>$600,000</b>. The supply curves are
        shown below in the interactable graph.
      </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 16px;">
        If the graph loaded properly, you should see two lines: one red and one
        blue in the right pan and some text and equations in the left pan.
        You can interact with the graph by clicking and dragging the graph.
        Usse your page scroller (two fingers on the trackpad or the scroller on
        your mouse) or the buttons in the top right to zoom the graph in or out.
        To see the equations that developed the graph, you may scroll through
        the pan on the left.
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Economical Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        It is clear from the supply curves for the Google Suite for Education
        and Microsoft's Office 365 for Education that the optimal product to use
        is Microsoft's Office 365 for Education. The functions for these were
        adapted from the websites for each of the products, which are included
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analyzing this in terms of economics, we know from experience using both
        Google Suite tools and Microsoft Office tools that they are substitute
        goods to each other. As a result, we can state that as the price of one
        object increases, the other would be preferred, and so its demand
        increases. So if the price of the Microsoft's Office 365 for Education
        plan increases, then my high school would prefer to change their Office
        Suite tool to Google's product. Considering that the demand is currently
        higher for Microsoft's Office 365 tool, for Microsoft to maintain that
        high demand is to maintain the price of its product such that it will be
        less than Google's product. Microsoft may raise the service's price per
        student per month according to the substitution effect of a price rise
        such that the price remains lower than that of its competitor good.
      </p>
      <h3>Revisiting the Original Question</h3>
      <p>
        So, <i><b>why</b> did the school administration block Google Suite from
        being used under their network, despite its utility?</i> Clearly, the
        school administration could have simply left it alone, letting the
        students use whatever product they want to use. However, taking into
        consideration that the administration spends about <b>$600,000</b>
        (maybe considerably more because of hidden costs), it makes sense that
        if people do not use the product, this price paid for this product
        becomes a sunk cost (service not being used). This sunk cost implies
        that the school administration "loses" money for whenever a student
        chooses to not make use of their Microsoft Office license. As such, to
        answer the posed question, to reduce the sunk costs from little use of
        an expensive product (Microsoft Office 365 for Education), Google Suite
        was blocked to direct more students to using the Microsoft Office 365
        tools.
